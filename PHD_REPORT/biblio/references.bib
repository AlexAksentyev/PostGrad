One  beam  is  polarized  and  its  electric  dipole moment  (EDM)  is  aimed  to  be  measured  by  the  frozen  spin  method.  The  second  beam,  which  has  different  from  the first one the Lorentz factor and charge to mass ratio will  be  used  as  comagnetometer  sensitive  to  the  radial component of the magnetic field.  Measuring by pickups  the  relative  vertical  orbit  shift  of  two  beams,  caused  by  the  presence  of  the radial field,  one  could  cancel  the  unwanted MDM spin precession, which mimics the EDM signal.  By  proper  choice  of  the  bending  electric  and magnetic field values one could make rational the ratio of the  revolution  frequencies  of  two  beams.  Examples  of  parameters for proton-, deuteron-, hellion- and some other ion  species  EDM  storage  rings  are  presented.  Finally,  a  new  method  of  increasing  of  the  spin  coherence  time  (SCT),   so   called   “Spin   Wheel”,   is   proposed   and   its applicability to the EDM search is discussed.},

The total spin precession frequency in the vertical plane due to the electric and magnetic dipole moments in an imperfect ring in a vertical plane is measured.

The calibration of the effective Lorentz factor using the polarization precession frequency measurement in the horizontal plane is carried out alternately in each CW and CCW operation. And the approximate relationship between the frequencies of the polarization precession in different planes is set to exclude them from mixing to the vertical frequency of the expected EDM signal at a sensitivity level approaching \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-29\}\$ \$e{\textbackslash}cdot cm\$.},

	abstract = {Precision experiments, such as the search for electric dipole moments of charged particles using storage rings, demand for an understanding of the spin dynamics with unprecedented accuracy. The ultimate aim is to measure the electric dipole moments with a sensitivity up to 15 orders in magnitude better than the magnetic dipole moment of the stored particles. This formidable task requires an understanding of the background to the signal of the electric dipole from rotations of the spins in the spurious magnetic fields of a storage ring. One of the observables, especially sensitive to the imperfection magnetic fields in the ring is the angular orientation of stable spin axis. Up to now, the stable spin axis has never been determined experimentally, and in addition, the JEDI collaboration for the first time succeeded to quantify the background signals that stem from false rotations of the magnetic dipole moments in the horizontal and longitudinal imperfection magnetic fields of the storage ring. To this end, we developed a new method based on the spin tune response of a machine to artificially applied longitudinal magnetic fields. This novel technique, called {\textbackslash}textit\{spin tune mapping\}, emerges as a very powerful tool to probe the spin dynamics in storage rings. The technique was experimentally tested in 2014 at the cooler synchrotron COSY, and for the first time, the angular orientation of the stable spin axis at two different locations in the ring has been determined to an unprecedented accuracy of better than \$2.8{\textbackslash}mu\$rad.},

The book includes the related connection to phenomenology, a purpose for which the precision experiments in this field — often rather elegant and requiring a good amount of ingenuity — are very well suited. The book discusses discrete symmetries (parity, charge conjugation, time reversal, and of course CP symmetry) in microscopic (atomic, nuclear, and particle) physics, and includes a detailed description of some key or representative experiments. The book discusses their principles and challenges more than the historical development. The main past achievements and the most recent developments are both included.},
